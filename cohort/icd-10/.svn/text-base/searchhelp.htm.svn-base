<H2>Help on the search function</h2>
<p> To search the classification, you need to type words in the search text box. 
The search will try to find the ICD items that include ALL of the words that you type. 
<p>The search 
will not only find the exact matches for words but also find partial matches. For example, if you type
<i>depress</i>, the engine will find both <i>depressive</i> and <i>depression</i>. </p>
</p>
<p>We have 3 kinds of searches</p>
<p><b>Full</b> search searches the full Volume 1 of the ICD-10. </p>
<p><b>- exclusions</b>; <i>everthing except exclusions</i>; search works like the Full 
search but it does not exclusions part of the items </p>
<p><b>Titels only</b> searches the text within the titles and it does not search anything else
such as descriptions, inclusions or exclusions </p>
